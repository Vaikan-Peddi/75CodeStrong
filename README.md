# Code String 75 Challenge

Welcome to my "Code String 75 Challenge" repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository documents my 75-day coding journey, inspired by Nishant Chahar's "75 Coding Strong Challenge." Over the next 75 days, I'll be diving deep into the world of coding, pushing my boundaries, and enhancing my skills.

## What's Included?

- **Code Challenges:** Each day, I'll be solving coding problems from various platforms, including LeetCode, as part of this challenge.
- **Study Materials:** I'll be following the StriversAtz DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) course and studying the "Introduction to Algorithms" book to deepen my understanding.
- **Progress Updates:** Regular updates, insights, and coding tips will be shared in the 'Progress_Log' folder.

## How to Navigate?

- **Code Challenges:** You can find my daily code challenge solutions in the 'Code_Challenges' folder, organized by day.
