# Progess of day 1
Today, I tried to complete three questions on LeetCode which you can check out in the Code Challenges folder. And, as it was raining I was not able to go for a run which I usually do in Sundays.
Drank 4+ litres of water and before sleeping I'll try to read a book names "As a man thinketh".
